    <p>In this project we had to get into a team which we were responsible to recreate our school Southwest CTA's website. So I was predominantly responsible for the HMTL, but did help out with the search engine optimization, and some pages of CSS. I learned a lot about my own ability and the ability of my partners in my group. I also learned even more about coding and especially CSS. Like hoe to make a proper drop down nav.</p>

  <img src="_assets/media/lvgea_logo.png" alt="Las Vegas Global Economic Alliance Logo" id="prj-svntn" class="prj-img-svntn">
   <p>The LVGEA Logo Project was the second logo client that we've had. We had to redesign their logo with the same colors, for their 60th anniversary. It felt quicker then the last logo project we did. I learned just how close I was to being in the top ten. It showed me how important it is to do my best at all times.</p>

  <img src="_assets/media/hour_of_code.jpg" alt="Teaching Hour of Code at Fine Elementary School" id="prj-sixtn" class="prj-img-sixtn">

    <p>Ever year Southwest CTA participates in the hour of code. Which is an hour to bring awareness to coding. This year Southwest CTA decided to have the web classes teach the students all from k-12 at Fine Elementary School. It was truly an amazing experience. I learned how little k-12 are, how much excitement they have, and are still eager to learn. As well as how it felt to teach others about coding.</p>

  <img src="_assets/media/drawing.jpg" alt="Linoleum Block Printing" id="prj-fiftn" class="prj-img-fiftn">
 <img src="_assets/media/photo.png" alt="Linoleum Block Printing" class="prj-img-fiftn_two">

   <p>This project was to take a picture of our choosing and to like stipple it. The Linoleum Block is to use a fine point pen or Sharpe to stipple dots into the image we meant ti to look like. SO I chose the gecko, you can see how it turned out. The photo above, and the Linoleum Block Printing above it. I learned patience, persistence with the exorbitant amount of dots required to complete the painting.</p>

  <h2>Acrylic Art Project -Spring 2015</h2>
  <img src="_assets/media/paint.jpg" alt="Acrylic Art Project" id="prj-frtn" class="prj-img-frtn">

  <p>This project was to tack a complex photo or image, that means a photo with multiple gradients, shades, colors, and textures. I truly loved this project, because i learned so much about acrylic painting. Such as: how each brush affects the color, shape, and thickness of a line. I also learned how to mix the proper amount of paints together. And how putting on layer on then letting it dry and putting on another layer adds to the depth of the painting.</p>
 </div>


 <div>
  <h2>Steve Jobs -Spring 2015 </h2>
  <img src="_assets/media/steve.jpg" alt="Steve Jobs" id="prj-thrtn" class="prj-img-thrtn">
   <p>This project was huge collaboration of a team of students, of which I was the leader. We got Steve Jobs and each of use had two or three pieces of his face. Then each person had a color scheme that they had to follow for that square. My pieces were the one up from the bottom left corner and the one in the bottom right corner. I really leaned about collaboration, time management, task management, and lining up huge pieces of digital art like a giant digital puzzle. Were any slight distance off would mean disaster.</p>

  <img src="_assets/media/three_point.jpg" alt="Three Point Perspective" id="prj-twe" class="prj-img-twe">

  <p>The Three Point Perspective Project was much like the one point except it was three times the perspective points. This was to take and design a picture in Sketch Book Pro of three point perspective. I surprised my self by adding in serial elements I didn't think of initially, like my hand. Also I felt I manged my time very well on this project in order to of completed what I was able to with this project.</p>

  <img src="_assets/media/calender_design.jpg" alt="Calender Design" id="prj-ten" class="prj-img-ten">

  <p>This was an art project to animate in a sketching software. In which we had to dabble in Sketch Book Pro's animation section. We took an idea, and we had to make each frame by mouse so to speak. I learned how intricate animation is, also how one idea can just lead to one after another.</p>

After learning basic Java-script, we had to incorporate it into a functional quiz using mostlyJava-scrip. Now it was more that the site was properly working as a on-line quiz. Rather than it had to look like the best website ever. I learned exactly how much Java-script I know, whall trying to grasp what I was trying to learn. I also found out who I think I would like to be my capstone partner.</p>
